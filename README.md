**Synopsis:** In a world where an infectious outbreak has plagued all forms of life as you know it, you must stealthily weave your way out of the ruins of what you once called ‘home’ as one of the only survivors of the virulent eruption of zombies. Whether it be hastily gathering survival supplies or vigilantly avoiding the gaze of bloodthirsty zombies out for your flesh, Zombie Dash has it all. But wait—there’s more! You’ve heard of a small village housing survivors some ways away, and it seems like going there would be your best bet to stay alive. Collect all of the food along your trail and make it out to the exit to ensure your safety, and make sure that the traps scattered across the map—or even worse, the zombies themselves—don’t get to you first.
